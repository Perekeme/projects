	<p>In the past, the development of the poultry de-feathering machines has not been well researched because only few 
	authors have worked on the machine. Adesanya and Olukunle (2015) developed a poultry de-feathering machine for small 
	scale farmers. The machine is 95% efficient and capable of processing a bird in 30 s. Also, a poultry de-feathering machine
	of about 96% efficiency has been developed by Tanimola et al. (2014). The major shortcoming in the existing machines is that
	the size of the bird processed per time is limited since the basins of the machines are fixed. </p>
